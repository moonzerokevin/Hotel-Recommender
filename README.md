#**My Personal Project**

## Hotel Recommender

This *hotel recommender* will recommend a hotel based on given choice list and the limit of price or satisfaction.

People who are confused with choosing hotel or who want to leave their comment of a hotel will use this app.

Because I have difficulty when choosing a hotel and spend a lot of time on it.
